## Tab tags

A **very** simple [Brackets](http://brackets.io) extension to add a newline and tab between HTML or XML tags, like Aptana Studio 3 does it.

### How To Use
Simply type, and if your cursor is between `<tag>|</tag>` (`|` is the cursor) and you press `ENTER`, it will be converted to
```html
<tag>
    |
</tag>
```

### TODO
* Check if this extension works in Macintosh.
* Add support for PHP braces, see issue #1
